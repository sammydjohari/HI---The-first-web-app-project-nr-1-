Hyper Island - The first web app

### :open_file_folder: The Brief:

Create a simple web app using fetch from an open API.


### :hourglass_flowing_sand: Time spent / Deadline:

1 week

### :dart: Goals:

- Learn using fetch()
- Use more JavaScript

### :grimacing: The process:

This being the first time I fetch from an API, it took me some time understanding the process of fetching and presenting the content (using the path etc). After some tries it went well and it is now working. 


### :blue_book: Learnings:

### :computer: Tech used in this specific repository:

- Github

- JavaScript
